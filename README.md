# Films_DM_2023
Project for the class data management HEC Li√®ge 2023

Introduction
We started a study to examine the success of movies using methods learned in class. Our aim is to analyze the importance of different factors to the success of these films in a pragmatic manner. To do this, we use tree analysis (learned from YouTube videos) to identify relevant issues. Our ultimate goal is to collect all this information from scratch without relying on pre-built databases. Instead, we try to extract data and clean the database to draw conclusions.

However, we know this task will not be easy, and our conclusions are somewhat uncertain. The available database was very incomplete, so we couldn't use all the variables we wanted to include, such as budget, which we felt had an impact on the film's success.
