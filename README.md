# Films_DM_2023
Project for the class data management HEC Li√®ge 2023

# Introduction
We started a study to examine the success of movies using methods learned in class. Our aim is to analyze the importance of different factors to the success of these films in a pragmatic manner and above all to be able to predict if a movie will be a succes or not. To do this, we have used tree analysis (learned from YouTube videos) to identify the importance of the features. Then, we also used different logistic regression methods as studied in class. Indeed, it would have been possibile to find and collect all this information online but we have decided to do it from scratch without relying on pre-built databases. Instead, we have tried to extract data and clean the database to draw the relevant conclusions.

However, we know this task will not be easy, and our conclusions are somewhat uncertain. The available database was very incomplete, so we couldn't use all the variables we wanted to include, such as budget, which we felt had an impact on the film's success.


# Recommendation 

We highly recommend the reader to start with the report of the project (Data_management_report) which will give good overview, explanations on the steps performed and analysis of the results. It is an excellent starting point before going in the different notebooks. 


# Main Notebooks

We constructed different notebooks, each of them having an explicit name:

Data webscraping: notebook with the code for the whole webscraping part using selenium

Data cleaning: cleaning of the dataset

Data visualization: exploratory data analysis (correlation, histograms, barcharts and map)

For the Machine learning part, there are two notebooks;

Data ML regression: with different types of logistic regressions

Data ML Decision tree: with our decision tree analysis

Data_management_report: the final report

Data management presentation: the presentation


# Datasets

We stored the different dataframes obtained into csv to be able to use them in all our notebooks
