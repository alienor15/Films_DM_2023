# Films_DM_2023
Project for the class data management HEC Li√®ge 2023

Introduction
We started a study to examine the success of movies using methods learned in class. Our aim is to analyze the importance of different factors to the success of these films in a pragmatic manner. To do this, we use tree analysis (learned from YouTube videos) to identify relevant issues. We also used different logistic regression methods as studied in class. Our ultimate goal is to collect all this information from scratch without relying on pre-built databases. Instead, we try to extract data and clean the database to draw conclusions.

However, we know this task will not be easy, and our conclusions are somewhat uncertain. The available database was very incomplete, so we couldn't use all the variables we wanted to include, such as budget, which we felt had an impact on the film's success.

# Main Notebooks

We constructed different notebooks, each of them having an explicit name:

Data webscraping: notebook with the code for the whole webscraping part using selenium

Data cleaning: cleaning of the dataset

Data visualization: exploratory data analysis (correlation, histograms, barcharts and map)

For the Machine learning part, there are two notebooks;

ML regression: with different types of logistic regressions

Decision tree Helo

MODEL

# Datasets

We stored the different dataframes obtained into csv to be able to use them in all our notebooks
